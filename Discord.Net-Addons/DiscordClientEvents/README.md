# How To Add These Events To Your Project

__NOTE__: This Requires Dependency Injection Be Setup For Your Bot. **[Tutorial Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ww6Dn0O70VA)**

**In this Class there is a list of every event you can add in the Discord.Net Library.**

## How To Add To Your Project

Goto the Class [Here](discord-client-events.cs) then copy all the raw data of the .cs file into your own new class in your bot project. Or Download the file and add it .cs to your project.

## How To Setup

```cs
//First you will need to change the namespace to reflect your bot's structure.
//In this example I am placing the discord-client-events.cs into a folder named Handlers.
//As such the namespace will reflect that.
namespace MyAwesomeBot.Handlers
```

```cs
//Now to actually use it.
//Add a using directive for the handler.
using MyAwesomeBot.Handlers;
```

```cs
//TODO: Add How to add it initialize it on the project.
```

That's it. If you have any issues using this or just need some help adding to it use the links below to find me on Discord.
